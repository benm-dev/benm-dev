## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started coding at **13** and have spent the last **8 years** building production systems that scale. I founded a hosting company that served **8,000+ customers globally**, built CAD systems handling **1,000+ concurrent users**, and co-founded an AI-powered job marketplace. 

Now I'm completing my **Diploma in Software Engineering at TAFE NSW** (graduating mid-2025) and **seeking a developer role** where I can focus on writing great code and learning from experienced engineers.

**Why I'm transitioning from founder to developer:**
- I love building software, not running businesses
- Want to learn best practices from experienced teams
- Prefer deep technical work over fundraising and operations
- Ready to contribute my production experience to a collaborative environment
